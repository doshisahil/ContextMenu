# ContextMenu

This project is under development.

Most of the time we as a developer run commands on a specific files/folder repeatatively. And as of now there is no easy way to repeat it accept creating scripts and storing it at some specific locations. In addition to that many time it happens that the input to the script is also same for some specific period of time.
e.g. copying binaries from build location to installation directory while analysing some issue. 

So this project is build to provide ease to developers(happy to know other use cases) in running this commands from context menu itself.
